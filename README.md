# Decentralized Property Sale #

The purpose of this project is to create a decentralized application to simplify the real-estate sale process

Typically, there are several parties involved: 
* Seller
* Buyer
* Inspector
* Lender

At a high level, the process involves: 
1. Seller lists a property
2. Buyer applies for purchase
3. Inspector certifies the property
4. Lender approves the loan
  * if all conditions are satisfied, then the funds go to the seller and the property transfers to buyer
